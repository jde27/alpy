#+TITLE: Computing with alpy

* What is alpy?

Short for "AL-gebra with PY-thon", alpy is (the beginnings of) a
computer algebra system written in Python, tailored towards
computations in triangulated $A_\infty$ categories. Specifically, it
allows you to define an $A_\infty$-category A and to perform basic
calculations in the triangulated category of $A_\infty$-modules over
A. For example, you can form the Yoneda module associated to an object
of A and twist it around other objects (that's basically all you can
do for now).
